# NeutralizeCarbon
We often take convenience for granted. The cool breeze an air conditioner provides, or the joy of flooring the accelerator is intoxicating, but the Earth has to face toxic externalities. While we have many campaigns and awareness schemes, they can seem too generalised or superficial. Our project aims to achieve the best of both worlds - to show the user exactly what he/she/they owe to our planet and reward them accordingly for doing the suggested actions. This would help in achieving what we call Targeted Conservation, something that could add to General Conversation to help Guard the Earth.
